<h1>IT 497 – Spiritual Progression & Professional Growth Portfolio</h1>
<p><strong>Ekpenyong Mfon</strong></p>

<section>
    <h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my IT 497 portfolio. This site documents my spiritual development,
        professional growth, ethical understanding, and reflective learning throughout
        my studies at Ensign College. My goal is to integrate technical excellence with
        faith-based principles, ethical leadership, and service-oriented decision-making.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> I take proactive responsibility for learning, leadership,
            and ethical decision-making. I strive to act intentionally rather than waiting
            to be compelled.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I commit to honesty, transparency, accountability,
            and ethical stewardship in all technical and professional work.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> I use technology to uplift others, solve meaningful
            problems, and contribute positively to individuals and communities.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio – Expansion & Deepening</h2>
    <p>
        My spiritual development has been shaped by the principle of personal agency.
        Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches that individuals should act with purpose
        rather than waiting to be compelled. This principle has influenced how I approach
        learning, leadership, and accountability in both academic and professional settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I have progressed academically and professionally, I have learned that spiritual
        growth is not passive. It requires deliberate choices, integrity, and a willingness
        to serve others. I actively strive to align my technical work with Christlike
        attributes such as patience, honesty, humility, compassion, and stewardship.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Résumé (Summary)</h2>
    <p>
        IT student with hands-on experience in system configuration, accessibility
        optimization, instructional design, ethical data handling, and user-centered
        technology solutions. Skilled in documentation, data tracking, network configuration,
        and service-oriented IT implementation. My career goal is to pursue roles in
        cybersecurity or systems administration where ethical responsibility, security,
        and service are central to professional practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio – Project Integration</h2>

    <h3>Primary Project: Community Computer Lab for the Elderly</h3>
    <p>
        This project was designed to reduce the digital divide among elderly individuals by
        creating a safe, supportive environment where seniors could learn essential computer
        skills and reconnect with family members through technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professionally, this project strengthened my skills in system configuration,
        accessibility optimization, instructional design, troubleshooting, and data-informed
        decision-making. Spiritually, it reinforced the importance of empathy, patience,
        service, and stewardship in technology leadership.
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>SQL Data Analysis Project:</strong> Applied principles of data integrity,
            accountability, and ethical stewardship while analyzing datasets and documenting
            findings accurately.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Network Configuration Labs:</strong> Implemented VLANs, access controls,
            and routing configurations while practicing disciplined documentation and ethical
            access management.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cloud & Systems Projects:</strong> Focused on secure configurations,
            scalability, and responsible resource management aligned with ethical IT standards.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis – Alternative Approach</h2>
    <p>
        The ethical dilemma in this project involved balancing the need to track participant
        progress with the responsibility to protect privacy and dignity. While data collection
        could improve instructional quality, excessive personal data posed risks to trust
        and participant agency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ethical principles guiding my decision included honesty, responsibility, respect
        for privacy, transparency, and stewardship of information. Rather than collecting
        detailed personal data, I implemented an alternative approach using anonymized progress
        metrics and voluntary feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compared to the original approach, this alternative resulted in better outcomes for
        all stakeholders. Participants felt respected and secure, trust increased, and the
        program retained sufficient data to improve instruction without compromising ethical
        standards.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>IT Project: Refinement and Ethical Integration – Project Refinement Record</h2>
    <p>
        Initially, the project functioned as general technical support. However, participant
        anxiety, limited hardware capabilities, and inconsistent learning outcomes revealed
        the need for refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
        I transitioned the project into a structured instructional design model. Lessons were
        broken into small, achievable goals to reduce anxiety and increase confidence.
        Accessibility settings were configured for low vision and limited dexterity, and
        older hardware was optimized for performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ethical considerations were integrated by treating participant data as a form of
        stewardship. Progress tracking was limited to essential anonymized metrics using
        Excel and Power BI. These refinements increased participant engagement, confidence,
        and learning consistency while maintaining ethical responsibility.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Video Reflection Script</h2>
    <p>
        In my video reflection, I explain how my spiritual beliefs influence my professional
        growth. I discuss how agency, integrity, and service guide my decision-making in IT
        environments. This project demonstrates how technical skills can be used to uplift
        others while maintaining ethical responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through refining this project, I learned that effective technology leadership
        requires both competence and compassion. Aligning professional work with spiritual
        principles has strengthened my confidence, accountability, and sense of purpose.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>
        I completed the assigned peer review by providing comprehensive, constructive,
        and actionable feedback addressing both technical quality and ethical integration.
    </p>

    <h3>Peer Review Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        I reviewed Matome Malatji’s Community Computer Lab project.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Strong accessibility configuration, data tracking,
            and user-focused design.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Integration:</strong> Clear emphasis on privacy, stewardship,
            transparency, and participant trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Actionable Feedback:</strong> Recommended improved scalability planning,
            clearer documentation, and expanded evaluation metrics.</li>
    </ul>
