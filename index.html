<h2>IT 497 – Spiritual Progression & Professional Growth Portfolio</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my IT 497 portfolio. This site documents my spiritual development, professional growth,
ethical understanding, and reflective learning throughout my studies at Ensign College.
My goal is to integrate technical excellence with faith-based principles, ethical leadership,
and service-oriented decision-making.
</p>
    
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Agency:</strong> I take proactive responsibility for learning, leadership, and ethical decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I commit to honesty, transparency, and accountability in all technical work.</li>
  <li><strong>Service:</strong> I use technology to uplift others and address real human needs.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio – Expansion & Deepening</h2>

<p>
My spiritual development has been shaped by the principle of personal agency.
Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches that individuals should act with purpose rather than wait
to be compelled. This principle has influenced how I approach learning, leadership, and accountability.
</p>

<p>
As I have progressed academically and professionally, I have learned that spiritual growth is not passive.
It requires deliberate choices, integrity, and the willingness to serve others. I strive to align my
technical work with Christlike attributes such as patience, honesty, humility, and stewardship.
</p>

<p>
Resources that influenced my reflection include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Come What May, and Love It</em></li>
    <li><em>Be Not Afraid, Only Believe</em></li>
    <li>Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28</li>
    <li>David A. Bednar, <em>Gather Together in One All Things in Christ</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Professional Resume (Summary)</h2>

<p>
IT student with experience in system configuration, accessibility optimization, instructional design,
and ethical technology implementation. Skilled in data tracking, user-centered design,
and service-based IT solutions.
</p>
  
<hr>

<h2>Professional Growth Portfolio – Project Integration</h2>

<h3>Selected Project: Community Computer Lab for the Elderly</h3>

<p>
This project was designed to reduce the digital divide among elderly individuals by creating a
safe, supportive environment where seniors could learn essential computer skills and reconnect
with family members through technology.
</p>

<p>
From a professional perspective, this project strengthened my skills in system configuration,
accessibility optimization, instructional design, and data-informed decision-making.
From a spiritual perspective, it reinforced the importance of service, empathy, and stewardship.
</p>

<h3>Additional Projects</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SQL Data Analysis Project:</strong> Applied data integrity and stewardship principles while analyzing datasets.</li>
  <li><strong>Network Configuration Labs:</strong> Practiced ethical access control and disciplined documentation.</li>
</ul>
   
<hr>

<h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis – Alternative Approach</h2>

<p>
The ethical dilemma in this project involved balancing data collection with participant privacy.
Tracking progress was necessary to improve instruction, but excessive data collection could compromise
the dignity and trust of elderly participants.
</p>

<p>
The ethical principles guiding my decision were honesty, responsibility, respect for privacy,
and stewardship of information. Rather than collecting detailed personal data, I adopted an
alternative approach that focused on anonymized progress metrics and voluntary feedback.
</p>

<p>
This alternative was ethically superior because it protected participant privacy while still
allowing the program to improve. It fostered trust, respected agency, and aligned technical
practice with moral responsibility.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>IT Project: Refinement and Ethical Integration – Project Refinement Record</h2>

<p>
Initially, the project functioned as general technical support. However, participant anxiety,
limited hardware capabilities, and inconsistent learning outcomes revealed the need for refinement.
</p>

<p>
To address these challenges, I transitioned the project into a structured instructional design model.
Lessons were broken into small, achievable goals to reduce anxiety and build confidence.
Accessibility settings were configured for low vision and limited dexterity, and older hardware
was optimized for performance.
</p>

<p>
Ethical considerations were integrated by treating participant data as a form of stewardship.
Progress tracking was limited to essential metrics using Excel and Power BI, ensuring transparency
without compromising privacy.
</p>

<p>
These refinements resulted in a measurable increase in participant confidence and engagement.
The project became both more technically effective and ethically grounded.
</p>

<h2>Video Reflection Script</h2>

<p>
In this reflection, I discuss how my spiritual beliefs influence my professional growth.
I explain how agency, integrity, and service guide my decision-making in IT environments.
This project illustrates how technical skills can be used to uplift others while maintaining
ethical responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Through refining this project, I learned that effective technology leadership requires both
competence and compassion. Aligning professional work with spiritual principles has strengthened
my confidence, accountability, and sense of purpose.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Peer Review Completion</h2>

<p>
I completed the assigned peer review by providing constructive, actionable feedback that addressed
both technical quality and ethical integration. The process strengthened my ability to evaluate
projects thoughtfully and communicate recommendations professionally.
</p>

<h2>Peer Review Evaluation</h2>

<p>
I conducted a peer review of Matome Malatji’s Community Computer Lab project.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Strong accessibility configuration and data tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical Integration:</strong> Clear emphasis on privacy, stewardship, and transparency.</li>
  <li><strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> Recommended scalability planning and clearer documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This portfolio represents my holistic development as an IT professional and disciple-leader.
It reflects my commitment to continuous improvement, ethical responsibility, and meaningful service
through technology.
