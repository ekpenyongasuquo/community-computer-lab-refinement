      <h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my IT 497 portfolio. This site documents my spiritual development,
        professional growth, ethical understanding, and reflective learning throughout
        my studies at Ensign College. My goal is to integrate technical excellence with
        faith-based principles, ethical leadership, and service-oriented decision-making.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> I take proactive responsibility for learning, leadership, and ethical decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I commit to honesty, transparency, and accountability in all technical work.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> I use technology to uplift others and address real human needs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio – Expansion & Deepening</h2>
      <p>
        My spiritual development has been shaped by the principle of personal agency.
        Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches that individuals should act with purpose
        rather than wait to be compelled. This principle has influenced how I approach
        learning, leadership, and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I have progressed academically and professionally, I have learned that spiritual
        growth is not passive. It requires deliberate choices, integrity, and the willingness
        to serve others. I strive to align my technical work with Christlike attributes such as
        patience, honesty, humility, and stewardship.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Resources that influenced my reflection include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Come What May, and Love It</li>
        <li>Be Not Afraid, Only Believe</li>
        <li>Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Professional Resume (Summary)</h2>
      <p>
        IT student with experience in system configuration, accessibility optimization,
        instructional design, and ethical technology implementation. Skilled in data
        tracking, user-centered design, and service-based IT solutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio – Project Integration</h2>
      <h3>Selected Project: Community Computer Lab for the Elderly</h3>
      <p>
        This project was designed to reduce the digital divide among elderly individuals by
        creating a safe, supportive environment where seniors could learn essential computer
        skills and reconnect with family members through technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a professional perspective, this project strengthened my skills in system
        configuration, accessibility optimization, instructional design, and data-informed
        decision-making. From a spiritual perspective, it reinforced the importance of
        service, empathy, and stewardship.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SQL Data Analysis Project:</strong> Applied data integrity and stewardship principles while analyzing datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Configuration Labs:</strong> Practiced ethical access control and disciplined documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis – Alternative Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The ethical dilemma in this project involved balancing data collection with
        participant privacy. Tracking progress was necessary to improve instruction, but
        excessive data collection could compromise the dignity and trust of elderly
        participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ethical principles guiding my decision were honesty, responsibility, respect
        for privacy, and stewardship of information. Rather than collecting detailed personal
        data, I adopted an alternative approach that focused on anonymized progress metrics
        and voluntary feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        This alternative was ethically superior because it protected participant privacy
        while still allowing the program to improve. It fostered trust, respected agency,
        and aligned technical practice with moral responsibility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>IT Project: Refinement and Ethical Integration – Project Refinement Record</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, the project functioned as general technical support. However, participant
        anxiety, limited hardware capabilities, and inconsistent learning outcomes revealed
        the need for refinement.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these challenges, I transitioned the project into a structured
        instructional design model. Lessons were broken into small, achievable goals to
        reduce anxiety and build confidence. Accessibility settings were configured for low
        vision and limited dexterity, and older hardware was optimized for performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethical considerations were integrated by treating participant data as a form of
        stewardship. Progress tracking was limited to essential metrics using Excel and
        Power BI, ensuring transparency without compromising privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These refinements resulted in a measurable increase in participant confidence and
        engagement. The project became both more technically effective and ethically grounded.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Video Reflection Script</h2>
      <p>
        In this reflection, I discuss how my spiritual beliefs influence my professional
        growth. I explain how agency, integrity, and service guide my decision-making in IT
        environments. This project illustrates how technical skills can be used to uplift
        others while maintaining ethical responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through refining this project, I learned that effective technology leadership
        requires both competence and compassion. Aligning professional work with spiritual
        principles has strengthened my confidence, accountability, and sense of purpose.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Peer Review Completion</h2>
      <p>
        I completed the assigned peer review by providing constructive, actionable feedback
        that addressed both technical quality and ethical integration. The process
        strengthened my ability to evaluate projects thoughtfully and communicate
        recommendations professionally.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Peer Review Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        I conducted a peer review of Matome Malatji’s Community Computer Lab project.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Strong accessibility configuration and data tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Integration:</strong> Clear emphasis on privacy, stewardship, and transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> Recommended scalability planning and clearer documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio represents my holistic development as an IT professional and
        disciple-leader. It reflects my commitment to continuous improvement, ethical
        responsibility, and meaningful service through technology.
